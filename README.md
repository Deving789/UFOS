# UFOS
Using Javascript, bootstrap to make a UFO sightings page

# Overview of the Project

For this project we are building an HTML page that will allow us to pull up information from a javascript data file using filters on the page. We want to use filters since we have many different sightings that occurred throughout the U.S.-- based on the different areas or what type of shape of the sighting.

# HTML Page and our results
